  <h2>General</h2>
  <h4>What is this?</h4>
  <p>It's a (quickly written) FAQ page with informtion about my status, in case I'm not checking email/Discord.</p>
  <h4>How are you?</h4>
  <p>I'm OK.</p>
  <h4>There's a serious problem! I need to contact you! How can I?</h4>
  <p>Discord, but if you're checking this page I'm probably not checking that. My email is on <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/puzzles/">this page</a> (the obfuscation of this address is not very effective against current AI but may work for another year). I may also not be checking it either, though. You can also text me if you know my number.</p>
  <h4>I'm not sure if this problem is serious enough!</h4>
  <p>It probably is serious enough. I will add a more detailed description here if/when someone contacts me for something not serious enough.</p>
  <h4>What's currently going on with you?</h4>
  <p>I have my thesis defense in the April 15-19 week. I will likely be fairly busy until then. I expect to go back to checking Discord regularly after that. I do have some medical stuff going on in the weeks after that, but it probably won't be severe enough to prevent Discord use.</p>
  <h4>When should I be concerned if this page hasn't changed?</h4>
  <p>April 20th probably? But most likely I just haven't remembered to update it in that case.</p>
  <h4>This page is missing a lot of the information I'd want.</h4>
  <p>Sorry. There are some things I want to/need to keep vaguely private, and also it was written extremely quickly (because I wasn't able to justify spending that much time on it).</p>
  <h4>Is this page a puzzle?</h4>
  <p>No.</p>
  <h2>Specific</h2>
  <h4>What are your upcoming hunt plans?</h4>
  <p>I am not doing BPH when it happens. I will likely postsolve it at some point. I will also solo or postsolve CMU, though it's not decided.</p>
  <h4>I want to see your thesis.</h4>
  <p>I'll likely do at least one run-through of it in the server you're probably in if you're reading this, sometime before the defense. If you're at my university, you can show up for the actual thing if you want (or I can do a practice in-person run with you there); you should've gotten an email about it from me via one of the lists, but can also email me.</p>
