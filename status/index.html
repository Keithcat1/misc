  <h2>General</h2>
  <h4>What is this?</h4>
  <p>It's a (quickly written) FAQ page with informtion about my status, in case I'm not checking email/Discord.</p>
  <h4>How are you?</h4>
  <p>I'm OK.</p>
  <h4>There's a serious problem! I need to contact you! How can I?</h4>
  <p>Discord, but if you're checking this page I'm probably not checking that. My email is on <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/puzzles/">this page</a> (the obfuscation of this address is not very effective against current AI but may work for another year). I may also not be checking it either, though. You can also text me if you know my number.</p>
  <h4>I'm not sure if this problem is serious enough!</h4>
  <p>It probably is serious enough. I will add a more detailed description here if/when someone contacts me for something not serious enough.</p>
  <h4>What's currently going on with you?</h4>
  <p>I've passed my thesis defense and am checking Discord more regularly. I do have some medical stuff going on in the next few weeks, but it probably won't be severe enough to prevent Discord use.</p>
  <h4>When should I be concerned if this page hasn't changed?</h4>
  <p>A week after I'm out of contact, probably.</p>
  <h4>This page is missing a lot of the information I'd want.</h4>
  <p>Sorry. There are some things I want to/need to keep vaguely private, and also it was written extremely quickly (because I wasn't able to justify spending that much time on it).</p>
  <h4>Is this page a puzzle?</h4>
  <p>No.</p>
  <h2>Specific</h2>
  <h4>What are your upcoming hunt plans?</h4>
  <p>I am solving BPH with another member of my time. I'm not sure what I'm doing for CMU.</p>
