      I have a program that generates these and will probably post more. For the two links below, you'll need to put in a puzz.link url such as <a href="https://puzz.link/p?simpleloop/10/10/30000k0l8000000800i1">https://puzz.link/p?simpleloop/10/10/30000k0l8000000800i1</a> (example taken from <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/bachelor_seal-puzzle/archives/87966369.html">Bachelor Seal</a>).</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Basics</h4>
    <p>This section only explains how the plain simple-loop-solving part works. For this section, looking at <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface/">https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface/</a> or <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface_qol/">https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface_qol/</a> might be helpful; the difference between the two preceding links is that the second has additional quality-of-life features that will be explained in the next section.</p>
    <p>In a simple loop puzzle, the goal is to draw a single loop with all the unshaded cells and no shaded cells, going between edge-adjacent cells and visiting each cell only once. In these interfaces, rather than inputting the loop directly, you find the loop via marking edges as used or unused, with two types of "parity deductions", both of which are about the perimeter of a subset of the unshaded cells (we will call a subset of the unshaded cells a "region"). Before we talk about the types of parity deductions, we will explain/motivate them.</p>
    <p>We define the parity of a cell to be 1 if the sum of its row and column is even, or -1 if the sum is odd (imagine a checkerboard coloring). We define the parity of a region to be the sum of the parities of all its cells. We define the boundary of a region to be the set of all edges between adjacent cells where one is in the region and one is not. When making a parity deduction, it is important how many possible edges along the boundary of a region are used by the loop/unused/unknown.</p>
    <p>One can see that the total parity of the edges actually used by the solution loop along the boundary of a region is twice the parity of the region (i.e. the sum of the parities of the actually-used edges). We'll call this the parity equality. This is the source of both types of parity deductions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the parity equality can only be satisfied by using all unknown edges of one parity and not using any unknown edges of the other parity, then that must happen.</li>
      <li>If the total parity of the region is 0, the region is neither empty nor the set of all unshaded cells, and there is only one possibly-used edge of one parity, that edge must be used.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Type 1 (the first type) of parity deduction is almost tautological (if the parity equality can only be satisfied by X, X must be the case). Type 2 is true because, for a region with 0 total parity, the parity equality means that the number of boundary edges used of each parity must be equal. But since the loop at some point goes from the region to the rest of the unshaded cells, the number of boundary edges used of each parity must be at least one. So if, for one parity, there is only one option, it must be used.</p>
    <p>Note that in some cases, a parity deduction can be made using either Type 1 or Type 2, even with the same region.</p>
    <p>How does this work via the interface? You can define a region via clicking on the cells you want to be in the region (which will highlight them), and then press P to do both types of parity deduction on it. The set of clicked-on highlighted cells will be called "the highlighted region" You can type X to clear the highlighted region (remove all the cells from it).</p>
    <p>(In either of the sites provided above, but not in the actual game, you can press 1/2 to do all the parity deductions of Type 1/2. 3 will be talked about a bit later. c will check if the simple loop is completely solved, but the game will automatically check this as discussed later.)</p>
    <p>A region with only one cell will never have 0 total parity, so it will never have a parity deduction of Type 2. However, it will often have a parity deduction of Type 1. This is just "if it already has two used edges, mark all other edges as unused, and if it has only two possibly-used edges, mark them as used". Pressing L will do this type of deduction on all cells, and then repeat until there are no more single-cell parity deductions. This can solve large sections of a simple loop. Since this is a very easy type of deduction, it will automatically be done in the actual game, and even in the QOL link.</p>
    <p>We define a "segment" of a partially-solved simple loop to be a group of cells connected by edges known to be used (this is a connected component of the graph with only edges known to be used). If the loop is solved, there is only one segment, and it is a loop; otherwise, there is more than one segment, and every segment has two ends. (Technically there are a few types of exceptions to the previous, such as one-cell segments, loops with one edge missing, and unmarked unused edges when the loop is otherwise complete. But the point holds going forward.) It's often useful to add a segment to the highlighted region (or remove it) all at once; for this, you can shift-click any cell in it.</p>
    <p>Parity deductions when the region is a segment (not part of a segment, a whole segment) fall into two categories. Some are single-cell Type 1 deductions on specific cells of the segment, as discussed in the previous. But sometimes there is a Type 2 deduction on the whole segment. This requires it to have even length, and for this not to be a type-1 single-cell deduction the endpoints of the segment must be adjacent. This type of Type 2 deduction on a segment is surprisingly useful. We'll call it "extending" in what follows.</p>
    <p>Note that you can get the effect of extending by using the rule "unless a segment uses all unshaded cells, the edge between its endpoints (if it exists) must be unused" (followed by Type 1 single-cell deductions). This is a fairly intuitive rule, because it just means the loop can't "close" early. It also sometimes makes it possible to solve simple loops that can't be solved by just Type 1 and Type 2. However, it doesn't really fit elegantly into the parity framework in my opinion, so it isn't possible to use in the actual game. You can do all deductions of this type in either of the above links by pressing 3.</p>

    <p>This section will discuss the additional quality-of-life features at <a href="https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface_qol/">https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/simple_loop_interface_qol/</a>, all of which also appear in the actual game.</p>
    <p>Firstly, you can "change hover mode" by pressing Y. This will toggle "hover mode" between three options, which control what hovering over (moving your mouse over) cells does. The default option is that it does nothing. Pressing Y will make it so hovering adds cells to the highlighted region. Pressing Y again will make hovering remove cells from the highlighted region. Pressing Y a third time will go back to the default of hovering doing nothing.</p>
    <p>Clicking on a cell will return hovering to the default of using nothing (this is because hovering and clicking are hard to use at the same time, so clicking generally means you want to disable hovering for now). Also, holding shift while hovering will add/remove entire segments, like holding shift while clicking does.</p>
    <p>Secondly, each segment has a color. This is based on assigning a (not directly visible) random-ish color to each cell and then coloring each segment based on the topmost/leftmost cell in it. This is useful, for example, for easily figuring out if two segment endpoints belong to the same segment. If two segments have similar colors, you can press Z to randomly recolor all segments, which is not guaranteed to fix the problem (it's random) but hopefully will happen to fix it.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, there are modes. These modes are mostly just for if you want to try to challenge yourself by not doing certain types of parity deduction. Default mode allows all parity deductions as described above, both Type 1 and Type 2. 1-less mode doesn't allow any Type 1 parity deductions except the (automatic) Type 1 parity deductions with a single-cell region. 2-less mode doesn't allow any Type 2 parity deductions except those on segments, i.e. extending. 12-less mode combines 1-less mode and 2-less mode; the only deductions are the automatic 1-cell Type 1 deductions, and Type-2 extending of single segments.</p>
    <p>There are known simple loops that are unique but cannot be solved by parity deductions as described above, but they're rare. There are, however, plenty of simple loops that cannot be solved in either 1-less mode or 2-less mode. There are also simple loops that can be solved in one of 1-less mode and 2-less mode but not in the other one, simple loops that can be solved in both but not in 12-less mode (because they require some deduction that can be of either Type 1 or Type 2), and even simple loops that can be solved in 12-less mode. (The simple loops that can be solved in 12-less mode are generally pretty easy, but hey, it is called simple loop.)</p>
    <h4>The actual game</h4>
    <p>In the actual game, solving a simple loop procedes basically as you already understand it, but it's the basic unit of progress. Once you solve a simple loop, after a fraction of a second another one will (usually) show up. So, there are two things to explain; the structure in which the simple loops are arranged, and some additional features the actual game has.</p>

    <h4>Q&A:</h4>
    <p>Can I read more about parity?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[answer] [may write something]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How are the simple loops in the game made?</p>
    <p>How do these simple loops differ from manually-made simple loops?</p>
    <p>Do modes have anything to do with the game?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most chapters have a subchapter that can fully be solved with one of 1-less or 2-less (but usually not with both). This is built into the generation algorithm. The first chapter, and another one, can fully be solved with one of 1-less or 2-less, and one subchapter of each can be solved with 12-less. Sometimes additional subchapters or individual simple loops will happen to be solvable with modes other than Default, but this is not guaranteed. In any case, the game currently only cares about modes in only letting you make certain deductions, and won't do anything special if you solve a simple loop in a non-default mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hovering seems to have a delay; I hover over a cell and it only changes color a fraction of a second later. Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm not sure. I think it has to do with all the cells giving JS too many elements to worry about. However, I've only noticed this with two simple loops both bigger than 50x50, which is itself bigger than anything in the game, so if you're noticing this in the game I'd sort of like to know.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Saving?</p>
    <p>More features?</p>
    <p>Why does this game exist?</p>
    <p>Development plan?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>After fixing saving and adding more easy features I/other players want, I'd like to build in stuff relating to the different modes more heavily, and also let players see more information about where the 🍓 are ahead of time rather than just coming across them. After that, [bingo]. However, most likely I won't get around to most of this.</li>
    </ul>
