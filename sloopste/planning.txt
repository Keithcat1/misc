The stats the grid *should* have in game state are:
- grid
- highlighted subset
- known edges

There should also be a position, progress, options, and time

Everything else can be stored outside of game state

# JSON.stringify(new Set([1, 2, 3]), (key, value) => value instanceof Set ? Array.from(value) : value)

when loading a game state:
- you should probably increase jumps?
- you have to unsetify the highlighted subset
- you have to set up the grid again based on data provided
